This project contains the example java application(s) used to test the
instrumentation based schedule controller. The applications need the
"instrumentor.jar" in the "lib" directory. You can obtain this by
running the "dist-to-test-proj" ant task in "dist.xml" in the
schedule-controller project. The *.launch files are eclipse launch
files that can be used to launch the example applications using the
controller.
